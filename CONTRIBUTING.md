# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute to my TIR repository!

I welcome submissions that fix typos and correct wrong or misleading content.
All you need to do is fork the repo, make a single commit with a concise,
descriptive message, and then submit it as a pull request.

If you are interested in contributing your own TIR content, I encourage you to
just create your own `tir`. As for this repo, I'd like to maintain it as my own
personal reading journey.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
