## TL;DR

Few great phrases:

> We’re bad at most things by default.

> Observation is no substitute for doing.

> There are a lot of reasons it’s so easy to be a bad manager.

> The hardest thing about business isn’t the business part, it’s the people part.

Good reminder that management is hard and not for everyone.
