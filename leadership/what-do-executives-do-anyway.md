## TL;DR

> (...) the job of an executive is: to define and enforce culture and values for their whole organization, and to ratify good decisions.
>
> That's all.
>
> Not to decide. Not to break ties. Not to set strategy. Not to be the expert on every, or any topic. Just to sit in the room while the right people make good decisions in alignment with their values. And if they do, to endorse it. And if they don't, to send them back to try again.
